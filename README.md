# Calculator Python

Project-based learning to validate basics of Python

Areas covered:

* Variables and Data Types: These are the containers used to store information, such as integers (whole numbers), floats (decimals), and strings (text) 🧠.

* Syntax and Indentation: Python uses whitespace 📐 to define blocks of code, making it look much cleaner than languages that use curly braces.

* Control Flow: This includes if statements for making decisions and for or while loops for repeating tasks until a goal is met 🔄.

* Data Structures: These are ways to organize data, like Lists (ordered collections) and Dictionaries (key-value pairs like a real-life lexicon) 🗃️.

* Functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific actions, helping you stay organized and avoid repeating yourself 📦.
